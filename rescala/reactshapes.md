ReactShapes is a small
drawing program. The user can drag and drop
different shapes on a canvas, connect them with
lines and change the stroke width and the color of
each shape.

The application supports an history and an undo
function. Finally, the drawing canvas can be shared with
other clients that participate in the same task from
remote.

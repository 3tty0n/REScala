      ReactShapes is a small
       drawing program. The user can drag and drop
       different shapes on a canvas, connect them with
       lines and change the stroke width and the color of
       each shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application supports an history and an undo
      function. Finally, the drawing canvas can be shared with
      other clients that participate in the same task from
      remote.

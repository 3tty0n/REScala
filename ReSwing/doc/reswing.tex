\section{RESwing}

{\bf Can we show the (complete?) interface of a RESwing component? I
  would expect there are some interesting things such as signals in
  the interface ecc.. -- the complete interface can maybe get a bit
  large. Very small but representative parts of the interface are
  shown in Figure 5 and 6.}

The RESwing library is an extension of the Scala Swing library, which
wraps around Java Swing. The Scala Swing library mirrors the Java
Swing class hierarchy and every component holds a reference to the
underlying Java Swing component. Building on Scala Swing, the RESwing
library adds another layer to this architecture. It provides its own
class hierarchy containing all reactively enabled
components. Figure~\ref{fig:overview} shows a small, representative
part of these class hierarchies.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/overview}
  \caption{Scala Swing and ReSwing wrapper architecture}
  \label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

The RESwing library provides reactive values for certain  properties
of the Swing components. User code can provide signals to be used for
these reactive values. As signals induce a highly declarative way of
expressing the computation of values, they are not re-assignable once
they are declared.

For that reason, reactive properties to be used with the RESwing
library are passed to the components' constructors and cannot be
assigned later. This also results in a slightly different approach
when constructing ReSwing components as shown in
Figure~\ref{lst:scala-swing-example} and
Figure~\ref{lst:reswing-example}.
{\bf I hope this is clearer now}


\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{codenv}
val label = new Label
label.text = "foobar"
label.preferredSize = new Dimension(400, 40)
\end{codenv}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{codenv}
val label = new ReLabel(
    text = "foobar"
    preferredSize = new Dimension(400, 40)
)
\end{codenv}
\caption{ReLabel component instantiation in ReSwing.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{RESwing Events}
\label{sec:events}
The RESwing library provides REScala events for discrete changes,
e.g., button clicks. Events exposed by RESwing components correspond
to Scala Swing events, but integrate with the REScala event system.
This means all REScala event combinators and interface functions can
be used with these events. Every RESwing event passes the triggering
Swing event on. For example for a Swing \code{ButtonClicked} event, a
REScala event of type \code{Event[ButtonClicked]} is fired.

{\bf But more expressive power ? What about
  the parameter type ? What about combinators?}


\subsection{RESwing Reactive Values}
\label{sec:reactive-values}


RESwing bridges between the Scala Swing getter, setter and reactor
system and the REScala signal and event system. Clients can define
reactive values that are passed to the RESwing interface. When these
values change, the GUI interface is updated accordingly. Also, changes
made by the user are reflected in the reactive values which the
RESwing library provides.

Certain values can be changed by both the application and the user,
i.e., they have multiple input sources. For example, the value
representing the text in a text input field can be changed by the
user by entering text, but it can also be set by the application.
The library ensures consistency between values set by the application
and those resulting from user interaction. This is achieved by
disallowing the user to make changes in certain cases.


There are three different ways to initialize a reactive value. This
aspect determines how changes to the reactive value are handled: {\bf
  show also the changes of the value -- I extended the text, I hope
  it is clearer now who can change which value when}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Immediate value initialization} will set the reactive
  value to the value given by the client code immediately upon
  creation. The user running the application can potentially change
  the value afterwards by interacting with the user interface.
  The reactive value will automatically reflect any the changes made
  by the user when accessed from client code.
  {\bf How? Can you show it in the example? -- I labeled the example
  in Figure 4 appropriately}
\item \emph{Event initialization} will update the reactive value on
  each event occurrence. Client code can change the value by
  triggering an event in the stream with the new value. The user can
  also change the value by interacting with the user interface.
  The reactive value will automatically reflect any the changes made
  by the application user or client code.
\item \emph{Signal initialization} ensures that the reactive value
  always holds the value given by the signal. Hence, the application
  user is not allowed to change the value through the user interface.
\end{itemize}

For all these cases, the respective value is passed to the constructor
of the component as shown in
Figure~\ref{lst:initializing-reactive-values}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{codenv}
// Immediate value initialization (using a string value)
val string: String
val label = new ReTextArea(
    text = string 
)

// Event initialization (using a string event value)
val event: Event[String]
val label = new ReTextArea(
    text = event
)

// Signal initialization (using a string signal value)
val signal: Signal[String] 
val label = new ReTextArea( 
    text = signal 
)
\end{codenv}
\caption{Initializing a reactive value of a ReSwing component.}
\label{lst:initializing-reactive-values}
\end{figure}


After a component instance has been constructed, all reactive values
can be treated as signals when accessing the properties (e.g.,
\code{Signal \{ label.text() \}}). Meaning no matter which of the
methods described above was used to initialize the reactive value, it
can be uniformly accessed and read as signal.
{\bf why not directly the signal? I would expect text is a signal --
Yes, \code{label.text} is a signal (or more precisely can be
implicitly casted to signal and thus just be used as signal),
\code{Signal \{ label.text() \}} was just an example}



\subsection{Extending the RESwing Library by Reactive Values}
\label{sec:defining-reactive-values}
The library offers a declarative syntax to define which reactive value
should map to which property of the underlying Swing component. Using
this syntax ensures that value changes are properly propagated from
the ReSwing library to the Scala Swing library and vice versa.

For a reactive property, you need to specify:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{getter} of the underlying Swing property to retrieve
  the value
\item the \emph{setter} of the underlying Swing property to set the
  value (if the reactive property can be changed by client code,
  otherwise the reactive value will be read-only, i.e. changes by the
  user running the application will be reflected, but client code
  cannot directly change the value)
\item a way to identify changes of the underlying Swing property,
  either by giving the bound property name or a Scala Swing event type
\end{itemize}
Additionally it is possible to force other properties to hold a
specified value, if the reactive value should not be changeable by the
user. This can be the case if the reactive value is initialized with a
signal as described in section~\ref{sec:reactive-values}.

Examples of some reactive values defined in different ways are given
in Figure~\ref{lst:defining-reactive-values}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{codenv}
class ReLabel(val text: ReSwingValue[String] = ()) 
                             extends ReComponent {
  text using (peer.text _, peer.text_= _, "text")
}

class ReTextComponent(val text: ReSwingValue[String] = ()) 
                            extends ReComponent {
  (text using (peer.text _, peer.text_= _, classOf[ValueChanged])
        force ("editable", peer.editable_= _, false))
}

abstract class ReComponent extends ReUIElement {
  val hasFocus = ReSwingValue using (peer.hasFocus _, classOf[FocusGained],
                                                      classOf[FocusLost])
}
\end{codenv}
\caption{Defining Reactive Values.}
\label{lst:defining-reactive-values}
%\vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Extending the RESwing Library by Events}
\label{sec:defining-events}
Similar to defining RESwing values as outlined in
section~\ref{sec:defining-reactive-values}, it is also possible to
\begin{itemize}
\item define events that get fired when the underlying Swing
  component fires an event or
\item declare events that offer client code the possibility to
  trigger certain actions by passing an event stream to the
  component.
\end{itemize}

Examples of these two use cases are given in
Figure~\ref{lst:defining-events}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{codenv}
class ReButton extends ReComponent {
  val clicked = ReSwingEvent using classOf[ButtonClicked]
}

class ReTextComponent(selectAll: ReSwingEvent[Unit] = ())
                            extends ReComponent {
  selectAll using peer.selectAll _
}
\end{codenv}

    <h2>Signals</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-post">
    <p>
      In REScala, the general form of a signal s is
    Signal{expr}, where expr is a standard Scala
    expression. When expr is evaluated, all Signal and Var
    values it refers to are registered as dependents of s; any
    subsequent change of them triggers a reevaluation of s.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:scala">
    val a = Var(2)
    val b = Var(3)
    val s = Signal{ a() + b() }
    println(a.getVal,b.getVal,s.getVal) // (2,3,5)
          a()= 4
          println(a.getVal,b.getVal,s.getVal) // (4,3,7)
        </pre>
    <p>
      REScala signals integrate seamlessly with OO design. They are
    class attributes like fields and methods. They too can have
    different visibilities. Public signals are part of the class
    interface: Clients can refer to them to build composite
    reactive values. Conversely, private signals are only for
    object-internal use.  REScala signals cannot be re-assigned
    new expressions once they are initialized.
    </p>

    <pre class="brush:scala">
  trait Animal {
    val age: Signal[Int]
    val name: Signal[String]
    private[myPackage] val speed: Signal[Double]
  }
      </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="page-header">
    <h2>Events</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <p>
      REScala supports a rich event system. Imperative events
    are fired directly by the programmer.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:scala">
    val e = new ImperativeEvent[Int]()
    e += { x => println(x) }
    e(10)
    e(10)
    // − output −
    10
    10
  </pre>
    <p>
      Declarative events, are defined as a combination of other
    events. For this purpose it offers operators like e1 ||e2
    (occurrence of one among e1 or e2 ), e1 &&p (e1 occurs and
    the predicate p is satisfied), e1 .map(f ) (the event
    obtained by applying f to e1 ). Event composition allows
    one to express the application logic in a clear and
    declarative way
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:scala">
    val e1 = new ImperativeEvent[Int]()
    val e2 = new ImperativeEvent[Int]()
    val e1 OR e2 = e1 | | e2
    e1 OR e2 += ((x: Int) => println(x))
    e1(10)
    e2(10)
    // − output −
    10
    10
  </pre>
  </div>

    <h2>Conversions</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <p>
      Since REScala promotes a mixed OO and functional style,
    it is important to manage state at the boundary between
    imperative and functional fragments of applications. For
    this purpose, REScala provides a set of functions for
    converting events into signals and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following code abstract over state to count the number
  of mouse clicks using the fold function.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:scala">
val click: Event[(Int, Int)] = mouse.click
val nClick: Signal[Int] = click.fold(0)( (x, ) => x+1 )
</pre>

    <p>
      The following code provides the position of the last click
  combining the click event and the position signal with the
  snapshot function.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:scala">
val clicked: Event[Unit] = mouse.clicked
val position: Signal[(Int,Int)] = mouse.position
val lastClick: Signal[(Int,Int)] = position snapshot clicked
</pre>

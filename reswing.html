    <p>
      The RESwing library is a reactive graphic library that
      easies the development of reactive applications using
      REScala.
    </p>
    <p>
      RESwing provides components that interface with reactive
      abstractions like signals and events. This way developers
      do not need to implement boilerplate code to connect
      signal-based applications with a graphic interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      RESwing is based on the Scala Swing library and it is
      compatible with Java Swing.
    </p>
    <p>
      RESwing has been originally contributed by Pascal
    Weisenburger an is now used in most of the REScala projects
    with a GUI.

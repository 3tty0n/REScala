      Universe is a program that simulates a 2D
      environment. The environment is populated by animals and plants; the
      simulation involves growing of animals and plants, movements of
      animals, and planning for food search.

    <p>
      The simulation evolves in rounds and the state of each
      element at a given step is a function of the other
      elements and of the state of the simulation in the
      previous step. This structure allows one to express
      several aspects of the computation functionally. However,
      the elements of the simulation are mutable objects that
      encapsulate state, so the OO and the functional style must
      be properly combined.
